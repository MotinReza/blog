The term refers to two things. One is the updated HTML language itself, which has new elements and attributes. The second is the larger set of technologies that work with this new version of HTML &mdash; like a new video format &mdash;&nbsp;and enable you to build more complex and powerful websites and apps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To understand how HTML has evolved over the years, let&rsquo;s look at the differences between HTML and HTML5.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>HTML vs HTML5</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>HTML is the World Wide Web&#39;s core markup language. Originally designed to semantically describe scientific documents, it has since evolved to describe much more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most pages on the web today were built using HTML4. Although much improved since the first version of HTML written in 1993, HTML4 still had its limitations. It&rsquo;s biggest was if web developers or designers wanted to add content or features to their site that weren&rsquo;t supported in HTML. In that case, they would have to use non-standard proprietary technologies, like Adobe Flash, which required users to install browser plugins. Even then, some users wouldn&rsquo;t be able to access that content or feature. Users on iPhones and iPads, for example, wouldn&rsquo;t be able to since those devices don&#39;t support Flash.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cue, HTML5. HTML5 was designed to cut out the need for those non-standard proprietary technologies. With this new version of HTML, you can create web applications that work offline, support high-definition video and animations, and know where you are geographically located.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To understand how HTML5 can do all that, let&rsquo;s look at what&rsquo;s new in this latest version of HTML.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What is new in HTML5?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>HTML5 was designed with major objectives, including:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Making code easier to read for users and screen readers</li>\r\n	<li>Reducing the overlap between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</li>\r\n	<li>Promoting design responsiveness and consistency across browsers</li>\r\n	<li>Supporting multimedia without the need for Flash or other plugins</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Each of these objectives informed the changes in this new version of HTML. Let&rsquo;s focus on seven of those changes below.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>New Semantic Elements</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>HTML5 introduced several new semantically meaningful tags. These include &lt;section&gt;, &lt;header&gt;, &lt;footer&gt; &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;mark&gt;, &lt;figure&gt;, &lt;aside&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;, &lt;data&gt;, &lt;time&gt;, &lt;output&gt;, &lt;progress&gt;, &lt;meter&gt; and &lt;main&gt;. These make it easier to write cleaner code that clearly delineates style from content, which is particularly important to users with assistive technologies like screen readers.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Inline SVG</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Using HTML4, you&rsquo;d need Flash, Silverlight, or another&nbsp;technology to add scalable vector graphics (SVGs) to your web pages. With HTML5, you can add vector graphics directly in HTML documents using the &lt;svg&gt; tag. You can also draw rectangles, circles, text, and other vector-based paths and shapes using this new element. Below is an example of a circular shape created using the SVG &lt;circle&gt; element.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>Form Features</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>You can create smarter forms thanks to HTML5&rsquo;s expanded form options. In addition to all the standard form input types, HTML5 offers more, including: datetime, datetime-local, date, month, week, time, number, range, email, and url. You can also add date pickers, sliders, validation, and placeholder text thanks to the new placeholder attribute, which we&rsquo;ll discuss later.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>WebM Video Format</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Before HTML5, you needed browser plugins to embed audio and video content into web pages. Not only did HTML5 introduce &lt;audio&gt; and &lt;video&gt; tags which eliminated the need for browser plugins, it also introduced the WebM video format. This is a royalty-free video format developed by Google that provides a great compression to quality ratio. This can be used with the video element and is supported by most browsers.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Placeholder Attribute</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>HTML5 introduced the placeholder attribute. You can use this with the &lt;input&gt; element to provide a short hint to help users fill in passwords or other data entry fields. This can help you create better forms. However, it&rsquo;s important to note that this attribute is not accessible to assistive technologies. Feel free to read more about the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/06/placeholder-attribute/\" target=\"_blank\">problems with the placeholder attribute</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Server-sent Events</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A server-sent event is when a web page automatically gets updated data from a server. This was possible with HTML4, but the web page would have to ask</p>\r\n\r\n<p>HTML5 supports one-way server-sent events. That means, data is continuously sent from a server to the browser. Think of how useful this would be if your website included stock prices, news feeds, Twitter feeds, and so on. Server-sent events were supported in the previous version of HTML, but the web page would have to repeatedly request it.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Local Web Storage</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>With the previous version of HTML, data is stored locally via cookies. With HTML5, web storage is used in place of cookies thanks to a scripting API. This allows you to store data locally, like cookies, but in much larger quantities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now that we understand what&rsquo;s new in HTML5, let&rsquo;s take a look at why you should be using it on your website.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Why HTML5?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>HTML5 offers a wide range of benefits over previous versions of HTML &mdash; some of which we&rsquo;ve mentioned briefly above. Let&rsquo;s take a closer look at just a few reasons why HTML5 is so special.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>It&rsquo;s compatible across browsers.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>HTML5 is supported by all the major browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, as well as iOS for Chrome and Safari and Android browsers. It can even work with the older and less popular browsers like Internet Explorer. That means when building with HTML5, you know that users will have a consistent experience on your site, no matter what browser they use or whether they&rsquo;re on mobile or desktop.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>It enables offline browsing.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>HTML5 allows you to build offline applications. Browsers that support HTML5 offline applications (which is most) will download the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and other resources that make up the application and cache them locally. Then, when the user tries to access the web application without a network connection, the browser will render the local copies. That means you won&rsquo;t have to worry about your site not loading if the user loses or doesn&rsquo;t have an active internet connection.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>It allows you to write cleaner code.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>With HTML5&rsquo;s new semantic elements, you can create cleaner and more descriptive code bases. Before HTML5, developers had to use a lot of general elements like divs and style them with CSS to display like headers or navigation menus. The result? A lot of divs and class names that made the code more difficult to read.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>HTML5 allows you to write more semantically meaningful code, which enables you and other readers to separate style and content.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>It&rsquo;s more accessible.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Also thanks to HTML5&rsquo;s new semantic elements, you can create websites and apps that are more accessible. Before these elements, screen readers could not determine that a div with a class or ID name &ldquo;header&rdquo; was actually a header. Now with the &lt;header&gt; and other HTML5 semantic tags, screen readers can more clearly examine an HTML file and provide a better experience to users who need them.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>How to Use HTML5</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>To start using HTML5 on your website, it&rsquo;s recommended that you create an HTML template first. You can then use this as a boilerplate for all your future projects moving forward. Here&rsquo;s what a basic template looks like:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n \r\n<code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\r\n&lt;html lang=&rdquo;en&rdquo; manifest=&quot;/cache.appcache&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;head&gt;\r\n&lt;title&gt;This is the Title of the Page&lt;/title&gt;\r\n&lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;bootstrap/css/bootstrap.min.css&quot;&gt; &lt;!-- This link is only necessary if you&rsquo;re using an external stylesheet --&gt;\r\n&lt;style&gt;\r\n/* These style tags are only necessary if you&rsquo;re adding internal CSS */\r\n&lt;/style&gt;\r\n&lt;/head&gt;\r\n&lt;body&gt;\r\n&lt;h1&gt;This is a Heading&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/body&gt;\r\n&lt;/html&gt;\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s walk through the process of building this file line-by-line so you can create an HTML template for your web projects. You can follow along using a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/website/best-html-css-editor?_ga=2.31388733.345887770.1597850445-1572292605.1597850445\" target=\"_blank\">basic text editor</a>&nbsp;like Notepad++.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>First, declare the type of document as HTML5. To do so, you&rsquo;d add the special code &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; on the very first line. There&rsquo;s no need to add &ldquo;5&rdquo; in this declaration since HTML5 is just an evolution of previous HTML standards.</li>\r\n	<li>Next, define the root element. Since this element signals what language you&rsquo;re going to write in, it&rsquo;s always going to be &lt;html&gt; in an HTML5 doc.</li>\r\n	<li>Include a language attribute and define it in the opening tag of the HTML element. Without a language attribute, screen readers will default to the operating system&rsquo;s language, which could result in mispronunciations of the title and other content on the page. Specifying the attribute will ensure screen readers can determine what language the document is in and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/website/web-accessibility?_ga=2.31388733.345887770.1597850445-1572292605.1597850445\" target=\"_blank\">make your website more accessible</a>. Since we&rsquo;re writing this post in English, we&rsquo;ll set the file&rsquo;s lang attribute to &ldquo;en.&rdquo;</li>\r\n	<li>Also include the manifest attribute in your opening HTML tag. This points to your application&rsquo;s manifest file, which is a list of resources that your web application might need to access while it&rsquo;s disconnected from the network. This makes it possible for a browser to load your site even when a user loses or doesn&rsquo;t have an internet connection.</li>\r\n	<li>Create the head section of the doc by writing an opening &lt;head&gt; and closing &lt;/head&gt; tag. In the head, you&rsquo;ll put meta information about the page that will not be visible on the front end.</li>\r\n	<li>In the head section, name your HTML5 document. Wrap the name in &lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt; tags.</li>\r\n	<li>Below the title, add meta information that specifies the character set the browser should use when displaying the page. Generally, pages written in English use UTF-8 so add the line: &lt;meta charset = &ldquo;UTF-8&ldquo; /&gt;.</li>\r\n	<li>Below, add links to any external stylesheets you&rsquo;re using. If you&rsquo;re loading&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/website/bootstrap-css?_ga=2.31388733.345887770.1597850445-1572292605.1597850445\" target=\"_blank\">Bootstrap CSS</a>&nbsp;onto your project, for example, it will look something like this: &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;bootstrap/css/bootstrap.min.css&quot;&gt;.

You&rsquo;ll write out the heading name and wrap it in &lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt; tags, and write out the paragraph and wrap it in &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; tags.</li>\r\n	<li>Lastly, don&rsquo;t forget the closing tag of the html element.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>When you&rsquo;re done, you can save your file with the .html extension and load it into a browser to see how it looks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"HTML template that would enable you to use HTML5 on your site\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Draft%20-%20HTML5.png?width=650&amp;name=Draft%20-%20HTML5.png\" style=\"width:650px\" /></p>\r\n', '230104114505.jpg', 'active', 1, '2023-01-04 10:45:05', '2023-01-04 10:45:05'),
(42, 46, 'What is CSS?', 'what-is-css', '<p><strong>C</strong>ascading&nbsp;<strong>S</strong>tyle&nbsp;<strong>S</strong>heets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simple design language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CSS handles the look and feel part of a web page. Using CSS, you can control the color of the text, the style of fonts, the spacing between paragraphs, how columns are sized and laid out, what background images or colors are used, layout designs,variations in display for different devices and screen sizes as well as a variety of other effects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CSS is easy to learn and understand but it provides powerful control over the presentation of an HTML document. Most commonly, CSS is combined with the markup languages HTML or XHTML.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Advantages of CSS</h2>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>CSS saves time</strong>&nbsp;&minus; You can write CSS once and then reuse same sheet in multiple HTML pages. You can define a style for each HTML element and apply it to as many Web pages as you want.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Pages load faster</strong>&nbsp;&minus; If you are using CSS, you do not need to write HTML tag attributes every time. Just write one CSS rule of a tag and apply it to all the occurrences of that tag. So less code means faster download times.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Easy maintenance</strong>&nbsp;&minus; To make a global change, simply change the style, and all elements in all the web pages will be updated automatically.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Superior styles to HTML</strong>&nbsp;&minus; CSS has a much wider array of attributes than HTML, so you can give a far better look to your HTML page in comparison to HTML attributes.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Multiple Device Compatibility</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Style sheets allow content to be optimized for more than one type of device. By using the same HTML document, different versions of a website can be presented for handheld devices such as PDAs and cell phones or for printing.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Global web standards</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Now HTML attributes are being deprecated and it is being recommended to use CSS. So its a good idea to start using CSS in all the HTML pages to make them compatible to future browsers.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Who Creates and Maintains CSS?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>CSS is created and maintained through a group of people within the W3C called the CSS Working Group. The CSS Working Group creates documents called specifications. When a specification has been discussed and officially ratified by the W3C members, it becomes a recommendation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These ratified specifications are called recommendations because the W3C has no control over the actual implementation of the language. Independent companies and organizations create that software.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>NOTE</strong>&nbsp;&minus; The World Wide Web Consortium, or W3C is a group that makes recommendations about how the Internet works and how it should evolve.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>CSS Versions</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Cascading Style Sheets level 1 (CSS1) came out of W3C as a recommendation in December 1996. This version describes the CSS language as well as a simple visual formatting model for all the HTML tags.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CSS2 became a W3C recommendation in May 1998 and builds on CSS1. This version adds support for media-specific style sheets e.g. printers and aural devices, downloadable fonts, element positioning and tables.</p>\r\n', '230104115337.jpg', 'active', 1, '2023-01-04 10:47:15', '2023-01-04 10:53:37'),
(43, 47, 'What is javascript?', 'what-is-javascript', '<p>JavaScript is a dynamic programming language that&#39;s used for web development, in web applications, for game development, and lots more. It allows you to implement dynamic features on web pages that cannot be done with only HTML and CSS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many browsers use JavaScript as a scripting language for doing dynamic things on the web. Any time you see a click-to-show dropdown menu, extra content added to a page, and dynamically changing element colors on a page, to name a few features, you&#39;re seeing the effects of JavaScript.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What Would the Web Look Like Without JavaScript?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Without JavaScript, all you would have on the web would be HTML and CSS. These alone limit you to a few web page implementations. 90% (if not more) of your webpages would be static, and you&#39;d only have the dynamic changes like animations that CSS provides.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>How JavaScript Makes Things Dynamic</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>HTML defines the structure of your web document and the content therein. CSS declares various styles for the contents provided on the web document.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>HTML and CSS are often called markup languages rather than programming languages, because they, at their core, provide markups for documents with very little dynamism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JavaScript, on the other hand, is a dynamic programming language that supports Math calculations, allows you to dynamically add HTML contents to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://thewebfor5.com/p/javascript/the-dom/\">DOM</a>, creates dynamic style declarations, fetches contents from another website, and lots more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before we go into how JavaScript does all of these things, let&#39;s look at a quick example.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Check out this codepen:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://codepen.io/Dillion/full/XWjvdMG\">https://codepen.io/Dillion/full/XWjvdMG</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the codepen, you&#39;ll see that as you type in the input field, the text shows on the screen. That is made possible by JavaScript. You cannot get this with HTML, CSS, nor both of them together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JavaScript can do a lot more than what I can cover in this article. But to get you started with JS, we&#39;ll look at:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>how to use JavaScript in HTML</li>\r\n	<li>data types</li>\r\n	<li>variables</li>\r\n	<li>comments</li>\r\n	<li>functions</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>How to Use JavaScript in HTML</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Just like with CSS, JavaScript can be used in HTML in various ways, such as:</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>1. Inline JavaScript</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Here, you have the JavaScript code in HTML tags in some special JS-based attributes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, HTML tags have&nbsp;<a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Events/Event_handlers\">event attributes</a>&nbsp;that allow you to execute some code inline when an event is triggered. Here&#39;s what I mean:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<code>Click me!\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>This is an example of inline JavaScript. The value of&nbsp;<code>onclick</code>&nbsp;can be some Match calculation, a dynamic addition to the DOM &ndash; any syntax-valid JavaScript code.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>2. Internal JavaScript, with the&nbsp;<code>script</code>&nbsp;tag</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Just like the&nbsp;<code>style</code>&nbsp;tag for style declarations within an HTML page, the&nbsp;<code>script</code>&nbsp;tag exists for JavaScript. Here&#39;s how it&#39;s used:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<code>\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<h3>3. External JavaScript</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>You may want to have your JavaScript code in a different file. External JavaScript allows this. For such uses-cases, here&#39;s how it&#39;s done:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<code><!-- index.html -->\r\n\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<code>// script.js\r\nalert(&quot;I am inside an external file&quot;);\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>The&nbsp;<code>src</code>&nbsp;attribute of the&nbsp;<code>script</code>&nbsp;tag allows you to apply a source for the JavaScript code. That reference is important because it notifies the browser to also fetch the content of&nbsp;<code>script.js</code>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><code>script.js</code>&nbsp;can be in the same directory with&nbsp;<code>index.html</code>, or it can be gotten from another website. For the latter, you&#39;ll need to pass the full URL (<code>https://.../script.js</code>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Notice the&nbsp;<code>.js</code>&nbsp;extension? That&#39;s the extension for JavaScript files, just like HTML has&nbsp;<code>.html</code>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now that we&#39;ve looked at ways to apply JavaScript to our HTML, let&#39;s look at some of the features of JavaScript.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Data Types in JavaScript</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In JavaScript, data has to be of one type or another. JavaScript needs to know this so that it knows how to use it with other data or how to operate on such data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are the basic data types that JavaScript supports:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Number (for example,&nbsp;<code>6</code>,&nbsp;<code>7</code>,&nbsp;<code>8.9</code>): on which you can apply arithmetic operations (like addition) and many more</li>\r\n	<li>String (like&nbsp;<code>&quot;javascript&quot;</code>,&nbsp;<code>&#39;a long sentence&#39;</code>,&nbsp;<code>a short paragraph</code>): anything found between single quotes (<code>&#39;...&#39;</code>), double quotes (<code>&quot;...&quot;</code>) and backticks (<code>...</code>). There&#39;s no difference between single and double quotes, but backticks have more features, such as:\r\n	<ul>\r\n		<li>interpolating variables in strings, like so:&nbsp;<code>My name is ${name}</code>.&nbsp;<code>name</code>&nbsp;here is a variable, injected into the string.</li>\r\n		<li>multiline strings. With normal quotes, you&#39;d need to add escape characters like&nbsp;<code> </code>&nbsp;for a newline, but backticks allow you to continue your string on another line, like so:</li>\r\n	</ul>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<code>let str = `I am a\r\n    multiline string`;\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Boolean (can only be of two values:&nbsp;<code>true</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>false</code>): more like yes (<code>true</code>) or no (<code>false</code>)</li>\r\n	<li>Array (for example,&nbsp;<code>[1, 2, &quot;hello&quot;, false]</code>): a group of data (which can be of any type, including arrays) separated by a comma. Indexing starts from 0. Accessing the content of such a group can be like so:&nbsp;<code>array[0]</code>, which for this example will return&nbsp;<code>1</code>, since it&#39;s the first item.</li>\r\n	<li>Object (for example&nbsp;<code>{name: &#39;javascript&#39;, age: 5}</code>): also a group of data but in the form of a&nbsp;<code>key:value</code>&nbsp;pair. The&nbsp;<code>key</code>&nbsp;has to be a string, and the value can be any type including another object. Accessing the content of the group is done with the key, for example&nbsp;<code>obj.age</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>obj[&quot;age&quot;]</code>&nbsp;will return&nbsp;<code>5.</code></li>\r\n	<li>Undefined (the only data this type supports is&nbsp;<code>undefined</code>): This data can be assigned to a variable explicitly, or implicitly (by JavaScript) if a variable has been declared but not assigned a value. Later in this article, we&#39;ll look at variable declaration and value assignment.</li>\r\n	<li>Null (the only data this type supports is&nbsp;<code>null</code>): Null means there is no value. It holds a value, but not a real value &ndash; rather, null.</li>\r\n	<li>Function (for example,&nbsp;<code>function(){ console.log(&quot;function&quot;) }</code>): A function is a data type that invokes a block of code when called. More on functions later in this article.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>JavaScript data types can be a bit complicated to understand. You may have heard that arrays and functions are also objects, and that&#39;s true.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Understanding this involves understanding&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dillionmegida.com/p/understanding-the-prototype-chain-in-javascript/\">the nature of JavaScript prototypes</a>. But, at the basic level, these are the data types you need to know first in JavaScript.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Variables in JavaScript</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Variables are containers for values of any data type. They hold values such that when the variables are used, JavaScript uses the value they represent for that operation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Variables can be declared and can be assigned a value. When you declare a variable, you&#39;re doing this:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<code>let name;\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>For the above,&nbsp;<code>name</code>&nbsp;has been declared, but it doesn&#39;t have a value yet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As you&#39;d expect from the data types section, JavaScript automatically assigns a value of&nbsp;<code>undefined</code>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<code>name</code>. So if you try to use&nbsp;<code>name</code>&nbsp;anywhere,&nbsp;<code>undefined</code>&nbsp;will be used for that operation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&#39;s what it means to assign a value to a variable:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<code>let name;\r\nname = &quot;JavaScript&quot;;\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Now if you use&nbsp;<code>name</code>, it will represent&nbsp;<code>JavaScript</code>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Declarations and assignments can be done on one line like so:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<code>let name = &quot;JavaScript&quot;;\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Why&nbsp;<code>let</code>? you may have asked yourself, and here&#39;s why: JavaScript supports three methods of variable declarations, which are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>the&nbsp;<code>var</code>&nbsp;operator: this has been with JavaScript since its inception. You can declare variables and assign values to them which can be changed later in the code. Here&#39;s what I mean:</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<code>var name = &quot;JavaScript&quot;;\r\nname = &quot;Language&quot;;\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>the&nbsp;<code>let</code>&nbsp;operator: this is also very similar to&nbsp;<code>var</code>&nbsp;&ndash; it declares and assigns values to variables that can be changed later in the code. The major difference between these operators is that&nbsp;<code>var</code>&nbsp;hoists such variables, while&nbsp;<code>let</code>&nbsp;does not hoist. The concept of hoisting can be explained briefly with the following code:</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<code>function print() {\r\n	console.log(name);\r\n	console.log(age);\r\n	var name = &quot;JavaScript&quot;;\r\n	let age = 5;\r\n}\r\n\r\nprint();\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>On calling the&nbsp;<code>print</code>&nbsp;function (<code>print()</code>), the first&nbsp;<code>console.log</code>&nbsp;prints&nbsp;<code>undefined</code>&nbsp;while the second&nbsp;<code>console.log</code>&nbsp;throws an error that it &quot;Cannot access&nbsp;<code>age</code>&nbsp;before initialization&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is because the&nbsp;<code>name</code>&nbsp;variable&#39;s declaration is hoisted (raised) to the top of the function and the assignment for the variable stays at the same line while the&nbsp;<code>age</code>&nbsp;declaration and assignment stays at the same line.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&#39;s how the above code is compiled:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<code>function print() {\r\n	var name;\r\n	console.log(name);\r\n	console.log(age);\r\n	name = &quot;JavaScript&quot;;\r\n	let age = 5;\r\n}\r\n\r\nprint();\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Hoist problems can happen unexpectedly, and that&#39;s why you should use&nbsp;<code>let</code>&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;<code>var</code>.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>the&nbsp;<code>const</code>&nbsp;operator: this also does not hoist variables, but it does one more thing: it ensures that a variable cannot be assigned another value other than what it was assigned during initialization.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>For example:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<code>let name = &quot;JavaScript&quot;\r\nname = &quot;Language&quot; // no errors\r\n\r\nconst age = 5\r\nage = 6 // error, cannot reassign variable\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<h2>Comments in JavaScript</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Just like HTML, sometimes we may want to put a note beside our code which does not need to be executed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We can do this in JavaScript in two ways:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>with single-line comments, like this:&nbsp;<code>// a single line comment</code></li>\r\n	<li>or with multi-line comments, like this:</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<code>/*\r\na multi\r\nline comment\r\n*/\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<h2>Functions in JavaScript</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>With functions, you can store a block of code that can be used in other places in your code. Say you wanted to print &quot;JavaScript&quot; and &quot;Language&quot; at different places in your code. Instead of doing this:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<code>console.log(&quot;JavaScript&quot;)\r\nconsole.log(&quot;Language&quot;)\r\n\r\n// some things here\r\n\r\nconsole.log(&quot;JavaScript&quot;)\r\nconsole.log(&quot;Language&quot;)\r\n\r\n// more things here\r\n\r\nconsole.log(&quot;JavaScript&quot;)\r\nconsole.log(&quot;Language&quot;)\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>You can do this:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<code>function print() {\r\n    console.log(&quot;JavaScript&quot;)\r\n    console.log(&quot;Language&quot;)\r\n}\r\n\r\nprint()\r\n\r\n// some things here\r\n\r\nprint()\r\n\r\n// more things here\r\n\r\nprint()\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>This way, we&#39;ve stored the repeated code block in a function that can be used wherever we want. But that&#39;s not all. Say we wanted to find the average of three numbers. The code for this would be:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<code>let num1 = 5\r\nlet num2 = 6\r\nlet num3 = 8\r\nlet average = (num1 + num2 + num3) / 3\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Doing this outside of a function may not hurt, but if we had to do that in many places? Then, we&#39;d have a function like so:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<code>function findAverage(n1, n2, n3) {\r\n    let aver = (n1 + n2 + n3) / 3\r\n    return aver\r\n}\r\n\r\nlet num1 = 5\r\nlet num2 = 6\r\nlet num3 = 8\r\nlet average = findAverage(num1, num2, num3)\r\n\r\n// later on, somewhere else\r\nlet average2 = findAverage(...)\r\n\r\n// later on, somewhere else\r\nlet average3 = findAverage(...)\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>As you&#39;ll notice in&nbsp;<code>findAverage</code>&#39;s declaration, we have&nbsp;<code>n1, n2, n3</code>&nbsp;in the parentheses. These are parameters, which serve as&nbsp;<strong>placeholders</strong>&nbsp;for values that would be provided when the function is to be called.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The code block uses those placeholders to find the average, and the&nbsp;<code>return</code>&nbsp;keyword returns the average from the function.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Placeholders make your functions reusable such that different values at different times can be passed to the functions to use the same logic.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>JavaScript has many more features we could discuss, but I hope this article has given you a clear starting point to go further. Now you should know what the language is and how you can use it on the web.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this article, we&#39;ve looked at how to add JavaScript code to our HTML files, the different types of data that JavaScript supports, variables that serve as containers for values, how to write comments in JavaScript, and a little bit about how to declare and use functions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are so many places to go from here, but I&#39;d recommend learning about&nbsp;<a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction\">The DOM and how JavaScript interacts with it</a>&nbsp;next.</p>\r\n', '230104115604.jpg', 'active', 1, '2023-01-04 10:55:32', '2023-01-04 10:56:04'),

It makes it possible for a web page or app to detect the visitor&#39;s screen size and orientation and automatically adapt the display accordingly. The mobile-first approach assumes&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchmobilecomputing/definition/smartphone\">smartphones</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchmobilecomputing/definition/tablet-PC\">tablets</a>&nbsp;and task-specific mobile apps are employees&#39; primary tools for getting work done. Bootstrap addresses the requirements of those technologies in design and includes&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchapparchitecture/definition/user-interface-UI\">UI</a>&nbsp;components, layouts, JavaScript tools and the implementation framework. The software is available precompiled or as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchapparchitecture/definition/source-code\">source code</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton developed Bootstrap at Twitter to improve the consistency of tools used on the site and to reduce maintenance.

The newest version is Bootstrap 5.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What is bootstrapping in statistics?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In statistics, bootstrapping describes the process of resampling a data set to create many simulated samples. This approach enables users to calculate standard errors, perform hypothesis testing and construct confidence intervals for different types of sample statistics.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What is bootstrap distribution?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The resampling procedure, bootstrapping, uses data from a sample to generate a sampling distribution by repeatedly taking random samples from a known sample.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What is bootstrapping machine learning?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>To improve the stability of machine learning (<a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/machine-learning-ML\">ML</a>) algorithms, Bootstrap sampling is used in an ensemble algorithm called Bootstrap aggregating or bagging. In bootstrapping ML, a specific number of equally sized subsets of a data set are extracted with the replacement.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What is Bootstrap Protocol?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Bootstrap Protocol (<a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/BOOTP\">BOOTP</a>) is an internet protocol in which a network user can be configured automatically to receive an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/IP-address\">IP address</a>&nbsp;and have an OS booted without user involvement. A network administrator manages the BOOTP server, which assigns the IP address automatically from a pool of addresses for a specific duration.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What is bootstrap CDN?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Bootstrapped websites often need an increase in speed.

It&#39;s the best approach to simultaneously enhance user engagement and page loading speed.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What is bootstrapping in general terms?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In the physical world, a bootstrap is a small strap or loop at the back of a leather boot that enables the boot to be pulled on. In general use, bootstrapping is leveraging a small initial effort into something larger and more significant.

(46, 49, 'What is PHP?', 'what-is-php', '<p>PHP&nbsp;(recursive acronym for&nbsp;<code>PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor</code>) is a widely-used open source general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited for web development and can be embedded into HTML.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nice, but what does that mean?

The article below covers all of the critical aspects of this decision.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What is Laravel?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://mdevelopers.com/laravel\">Laravel</a>&nbsp;is a cross-platform PHP framework for building web applications. It&#39;s a server-based platform that manages data using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, dividing an application&#39;s backend architecture into logical pieces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now that the definition is behind us, it must be fully understood. For this reason, we need to understand what the PHP Framework is. It is a set of code libraries with pre-programmed valuable functionalities such as an authentication tool, rooting tool, or HTML templates that allow users to build applications faster. Larevel&#39;s best PHP framework speeds up the web development process and improves the quality of the final product.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Laravel web applications are highly scalable and have well-structured codebases. Laravel&#39;s modular packaging system and strong dependency management allow developers to expand the functionality of their apps quickly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taylor Otwell created Laravel as a more sophisticated replacement for the CodeIgniter framework, which lacked certain features such as built-in user authentication and authorization support. Laravel&#39;s first beta version was released on June 9, 2011, with the Laravel 1 release coming later that month. Laravel developers are still tweaking bugs and improving functionality in updates and new versions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The newest version, the Laravel 8, continues the improvements made in earlier versions by introducing tons of new tools such as model factory classes, migration squashing, job batching, improved rate-limiting, or even Laravel Jetstream.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Is Laravel Frontend or Backend?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Laravel is a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://mdevelopers.com/blog/frontend-vs-backend-what-is-what-\">backend development framework</a>. It also has some frontend capabilities. Laravel has front-end-style building tools like validation systems, dynamic queries, and pagination so that developers can focus on other, more engaging things in code.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What does Laravel do?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Laravel has tools that help you build web apps easier and faster. And when you are done, the codebase is well-structured and easy to maintain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This PHP framework is known and willingly used by web developers. The fact that so many websites are created with its aid indicates it was not a random choice. What&#39;s more, this solution is used by companies such as 9GAG, Pfizer, or TourRadar. As one of the few PHP frameworks, Laravel can boast remarkable versatility and universality. It is used by companies specializing in IT, medicine, finance, travel, sales, entertainment, and others. Thanks to this versatility, they can build:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>social networking sites,</li>\r\n	<li>e-Commerce web sites,</li>\r\n	<li>multi and single-page applications (MPAs and SPAs),</li>\r\n	<li>static and dynamic websites,</li>\r\n	<li>enterprise-level applications,</li>\r\n	<li>content management systems, and more.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>What does Laravel contain?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Many modern PHP frameworks are object-oriented. It is good to understand some of the basics of classes and objects before using them.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>MVC Architecture</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern is a set of rules that explains how to construct successful web apps easily and straightforwardly. This main Laravel framework pattern helps bring order to the unstructured code. Thanks to MVC support, the process of web applications development is quick and convenient, no matter if they are large or small.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Artisan CLI</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Artisan Command-Line Interface (CLI) is a tool for web developers which helps them migrate data, manage databases, create the basic code, controllers, models, and other parts of an app. With Laravel&#39;s CLI, web developers can create MVC files and issue their commands. It significantly simplifies and shortens the development process.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Blade Template Engine</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Blade Template Engine is a simple but essential and powerful templating engine. It allows for connecting data models, processing the application&#39;s code in the source templates, directing the output to a certain text file or stream. That makes the whole process much more convenient. This templating engine is fast, secure, and easy to use.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Eloquent ORM</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Eloquent Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) is a tool for working with databases. It helps establish and maintain essential communication between a web application&#39;s architecture and its databases. The ORM uses an expressive PHP Syntax that is integral to the language of the framework, which means saving time and effort.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Redis</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Redis is an open-source, advanced key-value store. Because keys can contain strings, hashes, lists, sets, and sorted sets, it is commonly known as a data structure server. Laravel uses Redis to connect to an existing session and general-purpose cache. Redis interacts with the session directly.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Why Laravel?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Why Laravel\" src=\"https://mdevelopers.com/storage/posts/January2022/WhyLaravel.png\" style=\"height:326px; width:651px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When using Laravel, you have complete control over user authentication and role-based access control. The authentication system consists of all necessary steps, such as Login, Registration, and Password Reset, executed with a single command. All the required settings are included by default. As a result, account verification and access restriction are more complex, making them more secure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Laravel packages is a system which goal is to automate user requests. It allows you to use add-ons and modules, specialized software extending web applications. Laravel uses a composer as a dependency manager, which keeps track of all the data necessary to handle packages. Packages are a great way to speed up the development process by giving us all the essential features.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apart from the framework itself, Laravel has a lot more to offer. The expanding popularity of the framework has resulted in more diverse needs: packages, development environments, and the like. There are so many elements under the Laravel brand that they form a kind of ecosystem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&#39;s one of the most interesting and popular components:</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Sail</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Sail is a lightweight command-line interface for interacting with Laravel&#39;s default Docker development environment. Without requiring prior Docker experience, Sail provides a fantastic starting position for creating a PHP, MySQL, and Redis-based Laravel application. Many developers consider Sail the better, more convenient, and versatile Homestead alternative.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Valet</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Valet is a small, fast, low-resource (with about 7 MB of RAM) macOS development environment. It&#39;s not meant to be a total replacement for Sail or Homestead. Instead, it&#39;s designed for people with specific requirements because it provides a great alternative if you want flexible basics, prefers extreme speed, or work on a machine with limited RAM.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Cashier</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Laravel Cashier is an interface for subscription billing services from Stripe or Paddle. Cashier handles essential subscription management, but it also allows you to manage coupons, subscriptions quantities, swap subscriptions, cancel grace periods, and even generate invoice PDFs.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Spark</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Laravel Spark is a billing management panel that allows users to create and manage their subscriptions. Directly uses the engine on which it is based - Cashier. Spark is restricted to Stripe and Paddle as payment providers; Spark does not yet support custom providers. However, Spark can use third-party applications because they may be customized.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Pros and Cons</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Pros and Cons\" src=\"https://mdevelopers.com/storage/posts/January2022/ProsandCons.png\" style=\"height:326px; width:651px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Laravel is considered to be one of the best PHP web frameworks. The list of advantages developers mention is often endless, but that does not mean that it doesn&#39;t have its flaws.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When choosing a web application development tool, you should understand your needs and select a tool to meet these requirements. We present what Laravel is good at and where its functionality ends. Let&#39;s start with the pros:</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Great Documentation</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the most significant advantages of Laravel is how developer-friendly this framework is. Since developers created it for developers, the creators of Laravel made sure that everything contained in their work was understandable and well described. Every variation of Laravel comes with clear instructions of classes, coding style, methods, and made changes.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>PHP Support</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>PHP language is constantly evolving, and new features are added that are not supported by older development tools. It is not the case in Laravel. Thanks to backward compatibility using version 5.5 and newer, you can use new functions provided by PHP, for example, new interface, overloading, shorter array syntax, or namespaces.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Artisan</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Although we covered this tool before, it is worth mentioning as a huge advantage because of its use in saving time-consuming work creating the skeleton code, letting you do the rest while not focusing on common tasks.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Connection to Mail</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the advantages is connecting with mail services without any problems or worrying about the coding and/or security issues. Web apps must stay in touch with their users and inform them about new deals and offers. The framework uses an API rather than the SwiftMailer library. It also includes SMTP drivers, Mailgun, SparkPost, Mandrill, PHP&#39;s &quot;mail&quot; function, Amazon SES, and &quot;send an email,&quot; allowing you to send emails through local services or cloud-based platforms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is these advantages that convince software developers to use Laravel. For the sake of completeness, let&#39;s now get to know the disadvantages of this framework:</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Weak Composer</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In contrast to many other languages, Laravel&#39;s composer isn&#39;t powerful compared to Ruby gems, npm (node.js), pip (for python), or other package managers.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Quality Swings</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Not all framework elements are perfectly created or even good enough compared to the rest of the content. For example, dependency injection might occasionally become unnecessarily complicated. As a result, Laravel is not always made for amateurs and requires constant learning.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Bitter Sweet Updates</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It is a problem not only for Laravel but also for PHP frameworks. Sometimes the update significantly improves your web application&#39;s performance, but sometimes we dream to go back to the previous version because we cannot find ourselves in the new edition. It&#39;s best to save everything twice before moving on to the next version.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Wrapping up</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Laravel is a fantastic web development tool, and in many aspects, it has no competition. It also has an extensive ecosystem that is constantly growing, thanks to which an increasing variety of developers will find more ways to use Laravel for web development. It is significantly different from other web frameworks, but that is not a downside. In addition, the meticulousness of its creators allows you to familiarize yourself with the way it operates efficiently, and its use is a pure pleasure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want to discuss your project, arrange a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://mdevelopers.com/free-consultation\">free consultation</a>&nbsp;with our specialists.

All are free to download and use, all come with numerous add-ons for specialized functionality, and all can be customized to suit the needs of individual users.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, both Joomla and Drupal require a certain level of technical know-how and familiarity with HTML CSS and the programming language PHP. WordPress allows experienced users to work at that level, too&mdash;but, unlike Joomla and Drupal, it also includes features for beginners, so that they can set up a site quickly with no knowledge of code or programming.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>8 Benefits of using the WordPress Platform</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a look at a few key benefits of using WordPress to set up and run your business or personal site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1. Flexible and Adaptable for Changing Needs</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although WordPress was originally designed to support blogging and related types of online publishing, it also powers a wide range of sites with other purposes. WordPress is used to run complex sites for large multinational corporations, manage small businesses, and create personal blogs. WordPress sites can contain full-service eCommerce stores, showcase a portfolio, or host a social network, group, or podcast. Whatever a company&rsquo;s requirements, the core WordPress package plus a variety of basic and premium plugins that are suitable for your site. Thanks to its many themes and easy access to its source files, WordPress is also endlessly adaptable to a company&rsquo;s changing needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. User-friendly&mdash;Even for Beginners</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A WordPress site can be installed and up and running in a matter of minutes, even without any technical expertise. All a user needs is a domain name and a web hosting account.WordPress can be installed free through your&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bluehost.com/wordpress/wordpress-hosting\">WordPress hosting</a>&nbsp;provider or uploaded directly from WordPress.org. From there, an intuitive and easy to manage Admin dashboard has all the features needed to customize a site&rsquo;s heading and layout and to start creating pages and posts right away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. Themes Offer Multiple Options</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bluehost.com/blog/wordpress/the-14-best-free-wordpress-themes-7703/\">WordPress themes</a>&nbsp;offer users an array of choices for fine-tuning the appearance and functions of a new site, thanks to its large and growing directory basic and premium of themes. Many of these are instantly available to a new site owner through the WordPress theme directory, and thousands more can be purchased through design marketplaces and third-party designers from around the world. Themes can be previewed live and installed at any time to change the look and layout of a WordPress site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4. Plugins Extend Functionality</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>WordPress includes all the elements needed to create a basic site, but many users want more specialized functions related to a site&rsquo;s specific needs. The WordPress plugin directory includes hundreds of plugins&mdash;small pieces of code designed to perform specific tasks&mdash;that allow users to add features such as shopping carts, galleries, contact forms, and more to any compatible WordPress site.&nbsp;Users can also purchase and install hundreds of custom plugins from third-party developers. Plugins can be activated or deactivated and uninstalled as needed as a site evolves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bluehost.com/wordpress\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.bluehost.com/content/uploads/sites/2/2019/04/19-0111_ACQ-BH_2019_RefreshedBlogBanners_600x100_Educational-1.jpg\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5. WordPress Sites Rank High</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Searchability is key to ranking high on Google and other search engines. WordPress sites tend to rank high for their keywords, largely because they&rsquo;re constantly being updated and because WordPress includes a variety of tools and plugins for optimizing content for SEO (search engine optimization).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>6. WordPress Sites Are Mobile Responsive</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mobile responsiveness is also a factor in Google rankings, so websites need to look good on any device. WordPress offers a variety of responsive theme designs, and users can also make a static site responsive with plugins and adjustments to theme files.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>7. WordPress Sites Have a Built-In Blog</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since WordPress is a content management system software, it has multiple features that make publishing content easy. One of these is a &ldquo;built-in&rdquo; blog feature that can be accessed from any device, at any time, so that users who want to add a blog to their website don&rsquo;t have to create one separately. That makes it possible even for sites unrelated to blogging to use the blog feature for adding updates or announcements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>8. The WordPress Community Offers Support</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because WordPress is free and open source, it&rsquo;s supported by WordPress-loving communities around the world. This community of WordPress lovers is responsible for making changes to the source files and keeping WordPress updated and secure. The WordPress community also engages in plenty of outreach to users, hosting WordPress camps around the world and supporting the growth of local WordPress user groups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WordPress is used by over 30 percent of CMS-based websites worldwide, and it&rsquo;s easy to see why. WordPress makes the essential tools to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bluehost.com/blog/wordpress/how-create-wordpress-website-5-quick-steps-6878/\">create a wordpress website</a>&nbsp;available to any user, not just experienced web developers, and those tools can equally support a small personal site and a large, complicated corporate web portal. With an array of features such as themes and plugins designed to extend its functions, WordPress works for all kinds of sites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are building a WordPress site, you should consider a hosting provider that offers WordPress hosting.
